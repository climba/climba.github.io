                        <p>Hello, I’m Mike White and I’m passionate about web development and have been since 2008.</p>

                        <p>After spending a few years working as a full-time web developer for Concrete Exchange and Mace security I decided to move into freelance work.</p>
                        
                        <p>I then took on contracts with various companies including Bio Radiations, Petro Industrial, Etched Creative and any more.</p>
                        
                        <p>For a long time, one of my passions was rock climbing. After becoming more and more focused on climbing I was inspired to create a new type of training tool for climbers, this led me to invent The Gripster.</p>

                        <img class="rightimg" src="images/The-Gripster-2-0-pink-01.jpg" height="400" width="194" alt="The Gripster" />

                        <p>My years of web development led me to understand that many companies are competing for a slice of pie with a crowded space of saturated industries. I was inspired to create a new product in a new sector that was not saturated and didn’t have any competitors, yet!</p>
                        
                        <p>I set out to invent a new product that would replace an outdated form of training with a new dynamic one. Little did I know that I was birthing a new era of training tools for climbing.</p>
                        
                        <p>This process led me on a powerful journey of learning many new skills like 3D scanning, CNC routing, mold making, casting and 3D printing.</p>
                        
                        <p>After inventing the Gripster and selling it all over the world many climbers have been inspired to add their ideas to this new era of climbing training tools.</p>
                        
                        <p>After building my business and inspiring climbers to create exciting new training tools, I have begun to see how the next step in my creative journey is in app development. I have returned to the web development space to begin building the foundations that I need to develop the next generation of creative solutions.</p>
